# OOP-first-project
Project from second term of college
The project is world similation with various organisms presented by letters in console.
 Player's letter is @ in cyan color.
 To move around use arrow keys.
 The purpose of project was to improve my understanding of OOP.
Organisms have diffrent behaviour thanks to virual methods action and collision.
Base class Organizm (my apologies for polish names) and its derived classes zwierze and roslina are 
great example of polymorphism and of course inheritance. All variables inside classes are encapsulated.
