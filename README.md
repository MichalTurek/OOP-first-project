Project from the second term of college The project is a world simulation with various organisms presented by letters in the console. The purpose of the project was to improve my understanding of OOP. Organisms have different behavior thanks to virtual methods of action and collision. Base class Organism and its derived classes: Animal and Plant  are great examples of polymorphism and of course inheritance. All variables inside classes are encapsulated.
